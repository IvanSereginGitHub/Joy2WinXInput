# Joy2Win - XInput Support
This project adds XInput support (via https://pypi.org/project/vgamepad/) to the Joy2Win project made by Logan Gaillard and others (Both Joy-Cons only).
By default it uses N's buttons layout - but you can customize it via config.ini! 

For more information about original project please visit: https://github.com/Logan-Gaillard/Joy2Win.

## Installation

    pip install bleak pyvjoy pynput vgamepad
    ```

4.  Install vJoy :

        - Set 24 buttons or higher  
        - Restart your computer

    ```bash
    python main.py

## TODO
As of right now, certain features are not supported, not fully/properly working or are planned to be added:
1. Vibration - small implementation originally (only on connection), will try to add support for that.
2. Gyro (both ingame support and maybe custom emulating Left/Right stick?) - tricky right now since API is still unknown.
3. Mouse improvements (currently it is both laggy and drifting).
